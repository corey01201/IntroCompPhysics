    "Assuming that the thermal neutron induced fission cross section of 235U is 1 barn, 235U neutron induced fission emits fast neutrons with a probability of P1n=0.1,P2n=0.5, P3n=0.4, and the thermalization probability of those fast neutrons is 0.1 per generation, calculate the neutron density of 2 kg of 90% enriched 235U after 10000 generations. Assume the fission chain was started in first generation by the fission of 1e3 235U nuclei.\n"
